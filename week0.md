# Week 0

Hi everyone, welcome to the **Web dev track, cruX Summer Group 2022**!

@SimpLord#8622 (Shivansh), @Mirasma#2187 (Akshat), and I (PyRet#4288) (Soumitra) will be your mentors for this summer group.

## Intro

We want to keep this track as interactive and hands-on as possible, so we'll dynamically plan what we cover based on the response. If you learn fast, you'll learn more. We'll be covering HTML, CSS, and Javascript by default during this summer group, and the rest will be planned according to the response we get (We're hoping for React and Node.js).

Best case scenario, we get to work on a shiny full stack app, which will give you a really good idea of how to work on a general project of any size, and you get to work on a cruX project, and solve real life issues and bugs. if you manage to work and contribute on cruX projects, some of the seniors at cruX have some interesting prospects for you :eyes:. But remember, all that depends on you, and how you perform.

We will soon create a GitHub repo, where all the resources for the summer group will go.

## Some recommendations

We will start learning using video tutorials, because that is the medium most people are used to, but we **highly recommend** getting yourself to read to fix problems. You'll do this a lot in web dev, where you'll be reading documentation for every little thing when you need it, and it will help a lot in the future. Avoid youtube videos for now, get used to googling, using stackoverflow and reading basic documentation (Mozilla Developer Docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ are really good for basic HTML, JS, and CSS).

For **week 0**, we will get done with the setup for VSCode, and some extensions.
Here's a really nice video explaining exactly what VSCode is, and what extensions are. Follow along, and you'll be familiar with VSCode in no time:

After this, make sure you also install these extensions as well:
1. "Prettier - Code formatter" by Prettier
2. "Auto Close Tag" by Jun Han
3. "Auto Complete Tag" by Jun Han
4. "Auto Rename Tag" by Jun Han

For any questions, help, etc., you can ask in #discussion, or you can DM me or any of the mentors. We're always happy to help, don't be afraid to ask us anything.
