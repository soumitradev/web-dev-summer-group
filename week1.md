# Week 1

Hi everyone, this week we'll be learning the basics of HTML, and we'll cover a lot of general programming topics.

First we'll look at how the internet works, and how computers communicate with each other over the internet. We will also become more familiar with how this knowledge can be used to make a basic website.

By the end of this week, you should be able to:
- Know the different ways in which information is transferred over the web (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.)
- Know how requests work
- Know how to create a basic HTML website

Over the duration of this week, we'll post some resources and links to help you get started.

At the end of the week, we'll have a small quiz to test your knowledge. All the quizzes will be **open book** unless otherwise mentioned, and will only test your knowledge on how the web works.

As we get into more code-oriented weeks, we will replace quizzes with assignments, so that you get more hands-on experience.

We will post material on most days in the week, and most of the material will be spread out over the week evenly. If the week has an assignment, the dates will be adjusted so you have enough time to do it.

We **highly** recommend taking notes for the duration of this summer group. You might not refer to them later, after the quizzes end, but they'll help you learn better. These notes can be digital or on paper, it's up to you.


## How the internet works

For today, all you have to do is read the linked article, and understand how the internet works. If you have any questions, or if you're curious about something mentioned in the article, feel free to ask in #discussion, or look into it on your own!

Very rarely in this track will we directly link something and ask you to read the whole thing. Here, we have an exception, however. The MDN Web Docs have a very nice article that explains everything you need to know end-to-end.

You will learn about how computers use requests and responses to communicate, what a DNS is, what makes up a website, and some other small things that will help you along the way.
